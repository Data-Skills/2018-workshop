## Unix and Git

In order to complete computational exercises and the group project for this course, students will need access to a Unix operating system, which is the core for Mac OS X and Linux operating systems.

### Windows Users

A Unix environment can be emulated using the “​Git Bash​” program, 
by partitioning your hard drive and installing Ubuntu (a free version of Linux),
​ or by installing Cygwin​. The first solution is probably the easiest and works well.

* Git Bash: ​[https://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash](https://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash) 
* Ubuntu: [​https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wubi](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wubi)
* Cygwin: ​[https://www.cygwin.com](https://www.cygwin.com)

**Note:** Windows 10 Anniversary Edition (SP1) comes with a subsystem for Linux Ubuntu complete with bash, 
which can be activated via developer mode followed by enabling Linux Subsystem in Features 
(at least this was how it worked for the Preview release).  
There are a few caveats. bash cannot interact with Windows system files directory, and the home directory 
is obfuscated under hidden files and system directories. On the other hand, the C drive is mounted (/mnt/c)
so you can manipulate most files easily.

## R

* Download and install R from http://cran.r-project.org
* Download and install RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download
